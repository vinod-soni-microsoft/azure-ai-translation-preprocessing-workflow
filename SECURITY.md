- **Resolution Target**: Critical issues within 7 days, others within 30 days

### Security Update Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll confirm receipt of your report
2. **Investigation**: We'll investigate and assess the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We'll develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We'll coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Release**: We'll release the security update
6. **Credit**: We'll credit you (if desired) in the security advisory

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### File Upload Security
- **Validate file sources** - Only upload files from trusted sources
- **Scan uploaded files** - Use antivirus software before uploading
- **Limit file sizes** - Configure appropriate file size limits
- **Monitor usage** - Keep track of processing activity

#### Deployment Security
- **Use HTTPS** - Always deploy with SSL/TLS encryption
- **Secure credentials** - Never hardcode API keys or passwords
- **Environment variables** - Use secure environment variable management
- **Network security** - Deploy behind firewalls and use VPNs when appropriate

#### Azure Integration Security
- **Azure AD integration** - Use Azure Active Directory for authentication
- **Managed identities** - Use Azure managed identities where possible
- **Key Vault** - Store sensitive configuration in Azure Key Vault
- **Monitor access** - Enable Azure monitoring and logging

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- **Input validation** - Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Dependency scanning** - Regularly update and scan dependencies
- **Security testing** - Include security tests in your test suite
- **Code review** - Conduct security-focused code reviews

#### API Security
- **Authentication** - Implement proper API authentication
- **Rate limiting** - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS policy** - Configure restrictive CORS policies
- **Error handling** - Don't expose sensitive information in errors

## Known Security Considerations

### File Processing Risks

1. **Malicious Documents**
   - **Risk**: Uploaded DOCX files could contain malicious content
   - **Mitigation**: We validate file structure and limit processing scope
   - **Recommendation**: Use antivirus scanning before upload

2. **LibreOffice Security**
   - **Risk**: LibreOffice vulnerabilities could affect document conversion
   - **Mitigation**: Keep LibreOffice updated to latest version
   - **Recommendation**: Run in containerized environment

3. **Memory Consumption**
   - **Risk**: Large files could cause memory exhaustion
   - **Mitigation**: File size limits and memory monitoring
   - **Recommendation**: Configure appropriate resource limits

### Network Security

1. **Data in Transit**
   - **Risk**: Unencrypted communication could expose sensitive documents
   - **Mitigation**: Always use HTTPS in production
   - **Recommendation**: Implement certificate pinning for mobile clients

2. **API Exposure**
   - **Risk**: Unrestricted API access could lead to abuse
   - **Mitigation**: Implement authentication and rate limiting
   - **Recommendation**: Use API gateways for additional protection

### Azure-Specific Security

1. **Authentication**
   - **Risk**: Unauthorized access to Azure AI Translate resources
   - **Mitigation**: Use Azure AD and managed identities
   - **Recommendation**: Implement least-privilege access policies

2. **Data Residency**
   - **Risk**: Data processed in unexpected geographic regions
   - **Mitigation**: Configure Azure regions appropriately
   - **Recommendation**: Review data governance requirements

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Scanning

We use the following security scanning tools:

```bash
# Dependency vulnerability scanning
pip-audit

# Static code analysis
bandit -r src/

# Docker security scanning
docker scan document-processing:latest

# Infrastructure security
checkov -d infra/
```

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration testing** on API endpoints
- **File upload validation** testing
- **Input fuzzing** for edge cases
- **Authentication bypass** testing

## Secure Configuration

### Production Environment Variables

```bash
# Security-related configuration
HTTPS_ONLY=true
SECURE_COOKIES=true
CORS_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10MB
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=100
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=3600

# Azure security
AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
AZURE_KEY_VAULT_URL=https://your-vault.vault.azure.net/
```

### Docker Security Configuration

```dockerfile
# Run as non-root user
RUN groupadd -g 1001 appuser && \
    useradd -r -u 1001 -g appuser appuser
USER appuser

# Remove unnecessary packages
RUN apt-get remove -y wget curl && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Set security headers
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
```

### Kubernetes Security

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
